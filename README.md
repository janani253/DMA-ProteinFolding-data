This folder contains Diffusion map analysis data

Folder - Comparison of Unfolded States :
This folder contains contact maps (Correlation coefficients) between various unfolded regions observed within each DE Shaw Trajectory (https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1208351)

Folder - PDB Comparisons :
This folder pictorially compares the folded structures observed in our study vs that of the native structures of those proteins

Folder - Posteriori DMaps :
This folder chronicles the posteriori diffusion maps (diffusion maps constructed after the final step) for each of the Particle Swarms generated in this study
Subfolder - DecaAla-DMap-Annotated :
This subfolder further chronicles landmarks on the Deca-Alanine diffusion maps

Folder - step-wise-DMap-data :
This folder (and its subfolders) contains diffusion maps (.DMAP) calculated for each protein after each cycle of Particle Swarm Evolution. 
Note that the last 3 columns of each .DMAP file represent Q (from native conformation), HISASA and -log KT (PDF) respectively. And the 1st 2/3 DCs may represent the Diffusion Coordinates. 
Additionally this folder also contains Q values for 10ns Simulations started from the 10 starting configurations (randomly chosen from the unfolded state of the DE Shaw trajectories).

Folder - step-wise-DMap-images :
This folder (and its subfolders) recount diffusion maps as images, calculated for each protein after each cycle of Particle Swarm Evolution.
